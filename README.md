# Machine Learning Wine Price Prediction Models
## Author [Rohan Dawar](rohandawar.com)

### In this project I have built some machine learning models to predict the price of wine based on [zynicide's web scraped data](https://github.com/zackthoutt/wine-deep-learning) from [WineEnthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/)

### [Kaggle Page](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) where you will find the raw datasets used in my notebook
